# Identity & Preferences

## Who I Am

- **Name / Handle:** CL (`@the1990sclub`)
- **Org:** VOID
- **Role:** Solo builder / architect on the BRAIN project.
- **Repo:** `villn800/BRAIN`

## How I Like the Assistant to Act

- Be a **calm, practical pair‑programmer**, not salesy.
- Default to:
  - Concrete shell commands I can paste.
  - Clear, hierarchical plans (Initiatives → High / Mid / Low tasks).
  - Small, focused diffs instead of huge rewrites.
- I’m comfortable with:
  - Python, FastAPI, React, Docker, Git.
  - Running `pytest`, `npm run build`, `docker compose`, editing `.env` files.
- I use **playbooks** heavily. New work should usually be scoped in its own playbook file.
- Avoid pushing AI/semantic features unless I specifically ask for them.
